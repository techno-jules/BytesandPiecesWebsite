            overall experience was amazing. It was a great starting point for someone who is just beginning to enter web
            development. The workshop was interactive and helpful, overall a great experience.</p>

          <p>I really appreciated how each of the aspects was broken down into digestible pieces. Showing where to find
            information was also valuable. The atmosphere was welcoming and beginner-friendly, and I can see how it
            could spark the interest of girls and women! And lots of awesome resources, love it! This was my first Bytes
            and Pieces workshop and I can't wait for more!</p>

          <p>The hackathon experience was absolutely wonderful- what I liked most was how beginners friendly the
            hackathon was. And what I liked best about the hackathon was how it encouraged us to develop solutions on
            social issues which helped in making me more aware of the issues prevailing in our society and at the same
            time helped me in honing my [coding] skills.

          <p>I liked how our mentor explained the terms and asked if we had any questions throughout the workshop.
            Overall I liked this workshop! I’m new to coding but it was interesting for me to learn about the basics of
            JavaScript. I also liked how this workshop allowed people to ask questions if they had any!</p>

          <p>I attended the Java workshop- I’m quite familiar with Java, but I just wanted to see how it was being
            taught. I liked that the instructor kept it simple and engaging. As a mentor, I tried to look out for any
            questions from the participants. It was nice to see engagement from the participants. Those are the two
            aspects of the hackathon that I found useful from the participant’s perspective.

          <p>"I found the syntax of JavaScript really helpful as I never saw it before. I also found exploration of
            JavaScript in real time using VisualCode Studio. I liked the clarification by the workshop host. I found
            using a common code editor also really helpful to understand that you don’t need a big fancy editor. The
            workshop was really helpful especially for someone who never had knowledge of JavaScript before.

          <p>My favorite part of the hackathon is coding [my project] and what I liked best about our hackathon is the
            community involved. My hackathon experience was pretty good as I felt like I had enough time to complete
            what I wanted. Something valuable I learned from attending HackBytes is learning how a hackathon works.

          <p>The example websites shown and the explanation of flexboxes were the most useful. Our mentor did a great
            job covering different elements, showing examples and answering questions. The workshop had a natural flow
            and you could see she was well-informed. The resources and tips provided along the way were also very
            helpful.

          <p>I really enjoyed how professional and experienced the hackathon hosting team seemed. I liked that the
            prizes catered to different categories (social cause hack, hobby/extracurricular hack) instead of the usual
            1st, 2nd and 3rd. My favorite part was that the hackathon was not themed, so I could choose a topic to cater
            to my learning and strengths.

          <p>I think that the most useful aspect of the workshop was the example websites that were used to help explain
            certain parts of code. I also think that sharing the slides after the class is over is very useful in
            helping us to create our own projects outside of the class. I think that this workshop was very helpful and
            educational. I like the teaching style in which we were shown pieces of code and how they work within a
            functioning website.
