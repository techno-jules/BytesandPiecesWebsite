          <p><b>Helping students develop their passions, byte by byte, piece by piece.</b></p>
          <p>Bytes & Pieces is a student-run organization based in the USA who strives to develop students' passions in
            coding and music and inspire students to pursue careers in computing and/or music.
          </p>
          <p>For beginners and intermediates in music and coding.</p>

          <img src="images/designer.png" class="service-img">
          <h4>OUR INSPIRATION</h4>
          <p>I have passions in both areas, music and computer science, ever since I was introduced to a tiny keyboard
            my grandpa bought for my mom in the 80s and a computer class in 8th grade. Since then, I have never stopped
            playing the piano or coding on my computer. The amount of creating one can do in coding and music is
            astounding to me, and that’s the aspect that kept me intrigued.

            But I realized there was more to coding and music than just learning and creating.

            I started Bytes and Pieces, a youth organization, to share the excitement I discovered from two of my
            favorite passions with others. As both of these fields are highly understudied in schools, I decided to host
            workshops, contests, etc to provide a deeper or extra curriculum that explores topics in coding and music.
            We also hope to help increase diversity and inclusion, as minorities are highly underrepresented in both
            fields, and bring our workshops to under-resourced areas and around the world.

            I thought Bytes & Pieces might be a fitting name, as they reference both something to do with computer
            science and classical music. My piano teacher told me that in pop and jazz, they call it songs, but in
            classical music, they call it pieces. We hope you enjoy these topics as much as I do. <br><b>- Our
              Founder</b></p>

          <h4>OUR MISSION</h4>
          <p>At Bytes & Pieces, we strive to provide, free, accessible, and comprehensive curriculum, resources,
            workshops, and contests in the fields of music and computer science for middle school, high school, college
            students, and students who are in the workforce. As computer science and music are not part of the core
            curriculum of schools and both fields lack diversity and inclusion, these fields are barely explored in many
            schools and for many groups of people. We hope to provide unique content and experiences to students
            passionate in either one or both of these topics and hope that our program can encourage more participation,
            inclusivity, and diversity in the fields of computing and music. </p>

          <p>Hi all! Lighittha.P.R here. I am passionate about giving back to the society from where we all take so much
            from. I just hope to make a significant contribution to this society, so that it is a even better place for
            all of us to share our resources and live peacefully with one another and rejoice. I enjoy art,music,dance
            and reading books, basically, I enjoy literature in any form. I am part of various other organisations too
            and have played almost all roles . Everything is a form of art, so why not integrate STEM ?(which is itself
            the mission here.)
